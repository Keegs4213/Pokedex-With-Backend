# **MINI-PROJECT 1**

</br>

# Steps

1. Clone this repo to your computer (git clone "ssh code without quotes")
2. cd into the directory

3. Do some research, have a look at the free APIs and come up with an idea for a project that will test your knowledge from modules 1 - 4
4. List the requirements below
5. Do some low-fi drawings
6. Do a flow chart & hi-fi drawings on Figma
7. Create your application with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Fetch / Axios and Bootstrap
8. Fill in the questions below
9. Push your code to github

10. Present your project to the class (Aim for 5 min presentation. Use points below as talking points)

## ▪ What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it useful/successful?

```
Requirements for Pokemon webpage:
-Fetch data from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?offset=0&limit=2000
- Display cards of pokemon on a webpage that give information on the name, image of the pokemon sprite, species and other stats about the pokemon
- Include a search bar to search by pokemon
- Category selector for the "type" of pokemon e.g fire, water
-A way to bring the pokemon card into focus or a more detailed view

Gathering: I just looked at the pokeapi docs and saw what characteristics I could use and had the idea to make a pokedex which is the device in the game that tracks all the pokemons information.

Design: I used low-fi sketches and figma but when it got to the coding I did add some additional things like the animated background.
```

</br>

## ▪ Give a high level overview of your application and its features.

```
My application uses bootstrap cards and Js fetch to take information from the pokeapi and display characterisitics of pokemon like name, height, weight, id, type and "moves". You can search using the search bar to search pokemon by name or use the drop down selector to display certain "types' of pokemon.
```

</br>

## ▪ Where does its data come from (external/internal APIs)?

```
External API: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon
```

</br>

## ▪ How can the user interact with this data?

```
Change the cards displayed on the page using the search bar or type selector to filter the cards shown. Also can click on the cards to display a modal version of the card. Also the landing page has a button to take you to the main page.
```

</br>

## ▪ What JS techniques have you used ?

_(eg. objects/arrays/DOMfunctions/loops/functions/ifs)_

```
Object, arrays, functions, async functions, fetch, loops, event listener, maps.
```

</br>

## ▪ What external tools/libraries have you used? How? Why?

_(eg. bootstrap/axios/charts)_

```
Bootstrap, Iconify, Google fonts

Mainly to layout the cards and make everything on the page look nice
```

</br>

## ▪ What kinds of HTML elements have you used

(eg. tables, forms, divs, lists, headings, menus, videos, images)?

```
Divs, forms, templates, headings, links, images, audio, lists.
```

</br>

## ▪ What kinds of CSS features have you used ?

_(eg. animations, backgrounds, fonts, colours, flexbox, grid)_

```
Animation, backgrounds, fonts, colours, flexbox, grid, responsive webdesign.
```

</br>

## ▪ How might you extend the features of your application in future?

```
Use a higher limit of pokemon on the page, add more functionality/interactivity such as search by ID etc. Make search bar and type selector work at same time in conjunction.
```
